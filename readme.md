# Kindle Clippings Viewer

[Run the Kindle Clippings Viewer!](https://ptgullas.github.io/KindleClippingsViewerJs/clippingsviewer.html)

I wanted something that would let me easily view the "My Clippings.txt" file from my Kindle. This displays all of the clippings (Highlights, Notes and Bookmarks) contained for each book. 

Books are sorted the default way (in order of books that you've added clippings for). Within each book, each clipping is sorted by Location. 

Clicking on a clipping will display its details in the right hand panel. There is a button that will copy the highlighted text or note to the clipboard. 

Clicking the book title in the left-hand frame will copy all of the clippings for that book to the clipboard in the form `{ClippingType}: {ClippingText}`.

Code was initially generated by Copilot with some additions & modifications by me (I wanted something quick & easy).
